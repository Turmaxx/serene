I just came to know that Bram Moolenaar, the creator and [BDFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life) of [Vim](https://vim.org), passed away today. An [email](https://groups.google.com/g/vim_announce/c/tWahca9zkt4) was sent to the vim group mailing list about Bram's passing.

I never met him but I’ve been using Vim since highschool so he’s indirectly been a huge part of my professional and hobbiyist life.

I’m sure Vim isn’t going anywhere (hopefully it's not archived or something), and NeoVim is obviously there if Vim development should cease, and people would move to it since the maintainer has passed away and the project is going in a great direction. Still, this news hits hard for me for some reason.

Best wishes to Bram’s family and the people who worked with him on Vim.

Thanks for the awesome editor, Bram! RIP.
