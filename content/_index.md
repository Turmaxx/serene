A junior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science with experience on Cloud,Site Reliability, Software and Platform Engineering.

I enjoyed developing open-souce projects on my free time and tinkering with my Linux machine running NixOS, previously running Manjaro and Arch.

This little sleek, minimalist site is a reflection of my personal philsophy, but yeah I made this site so I can share learnings, experiences, whatever i find interesting, and also so I can go hey I wrote that like 10 years ago lol.

I'm a Nix and Neovim user, and I build things with Rust, Haskell, Go and Python and other languages my heart desired.

This is my personal website. I'll make blog posts about the things I create or discover here. Both for my own benefit, in case I forget it later and want to go back to it, and maybe helping someone in the future.
