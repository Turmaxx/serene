## Overview

Go is a statically typed language, meaning the type of a variable is known at compile time, but it also offers type inference, allowing the compiler to deduce the type of a variable from its assigned value using the `:=` operator.

> Here's a more detailed explanation:

## Static Typing:

In Go, once a variable is declared with a specific type (e.g., `int`, `string`, `bool`), it cannot be reassigned a value of a different type.

## Type Inference:

Go's type inference mechanism, using the `:=` operator, enables you to declare variables without explicitly specifying their type. The compiler infers the type from the value on the right-hand side of the assignment.

**Example:** `x := 10` infers that `x` is an `int`.

## Benefits of Static Typing:

- **Early Error Detection:** Type errors are caught during compilation, preventing runtime crashes.
- **Improved Code Readability:** Explicit type declarations (or inferred types) can make code easier to understand.
- **Compiler Optimization:** Knowing the type of variables allows the compiler to perform optimizations.

## Benefits of Type Inference:

- **Conciseness:** Reduces verbosity in code by allowing type declarations to be omitted.
- **Improved Readability:** In some cases, inferred types can make code easier to read, especially when the type is obvious from the context.

## Trade-offs:

- **Static Typing:** Can be more verbose than dynamic typing, requiring explicit type declarations in some cases.
- **Type Inference:** Might lead to less explicit code, potentially making it harder to understand the type of a variable at first glance.

# Other Differences Between `Static Typing: var variableName variableType` and `Type Inference: :=`

There are some small differences between the var var :=:

| `Static Typing: var varibaleName variableType`                       | `Type Inference :=`                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Can be used **inside** and **outside** of functions                  | Can only be used **inside** functions                                                                   |
| Variable declaration and value assignment **can be done separately** | Variable declaration and value assignment **cannot be done separately** (must be done in the same line) |
